## MedChange

Code and datasets for the EMNLP 2025 paper "**[Facts Fade Fast: Evaluating Memorization of Outdated Medical Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04304)**".

This repository is largely based on the original MedChange codebase by Vladika et al.  
Our main additions are related to reproducing and extending the experiments on a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster.

### Additions in this fork

- **`HPC_results/`**  
  Contains the code and scripts used to re-prompt the models on the High Performance Computing cluster at the IT University of Copenhagen.

- **`GeneratedAnswers/Replicability_models/`**  
  Stores the outputs generated by our replicated and re-prompted models.

- **`experiments_reproduce.ipynb`**  
  Jupyter notebook used to run our reproduction experiments and evaluate the model outputs (including our light preprocessing step and updated prompts).

Apart from these components, the rest of the code is a direct clone of the original MedChange repository.
